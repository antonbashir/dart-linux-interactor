# 👋 Hello

Greetings. Welcome to the documentation of the dart-linux-interactor (DLI) library.

The main purpose of the project is to connect Dart-based applications and libraries with Linux-based libraries.

# 🧠 Reasoning

In my plans there will be my own Linux Kernel based operation system.

It will has only Dart and Linux pure C/C++ modules. 

And to interact and communicate between dart and linux sides there is a need of something between.

For now we have the most popular way to do it is Dart FFI. But it is too poor for my tasks.

I need something with the next features:
* multi-isolates to multi-threads interaction
* multi-threads to multi-isolates interaction
* pools for objects and buffers out-of-the box
* lock-free (at least at user-code level)

So I've decided to combine all theese features the single library for Dart + Linux interaction.

# 🔨 Usage

There are two parts of DLI: Native and Dart. 

## How to use Dart part ?

Firstly you need add to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  linux_interactor:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/antonbashir/dart-linux-interactor
      path: dart
```

Secondly you need to generate FFI bindings for your native code.

After this you can use DLI:

```dart
class SampleProducer implements InteractorProducer {
  late final InteractorMethod sampleCallDart;

  @override
  void initialize(InteractorProducerRegistrat executor) {
    sampleCallDart = executor.register(bindings.addresses.sample_call_dart);
  }
}

Future<void> main(List<String> args) async {
  final interactor = Interactor();
  final worker = InteractorWorker(interactor.worker(InteractorDefaults.worker()));
  await worker.initialize();
  final producer = worker.producer(SampleProducer());
  worker.activate();
  final future = producer.sampleCallDart(
    native.ref.descriptor,
    configurator: (message) => message
      ..allocateOutputString(64)
      ..setInputString("I am Dart"),
  );
  // Other code...
  await interactor.shutdown();
}
```

## How to use Native part ?

The native part placed here [include](https://github.com/antonbashir/dart-linux-interactor/tree/main/native/include).

You can use your own C/C++ manager to download and include the headers.

After this you need to load the [library](https://github.com/antonbashir/dart-linux-interactor/blob/main/dart/native/libinteractor.so) and you will be able to use DLI Native API.

# 💥 Samples

Basic sample of usage lives [here](https://github.com/antonbashir/dart-linux-sample). 

# ✋ Limitations

The main limitation is resource control management up to user. 

It means that if you need to receive the string from the native part then you should allocate this is string in the Dart part and release also in the Dart part.

This limitation came from the principle: requester controls the resources. 

This way provides us to use efficient lock-free single-thread pools and buffers because allocation and free happens on the same thread/isolate.
