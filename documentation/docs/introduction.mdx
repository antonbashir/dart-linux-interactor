# 👋 Hello

Greetings. Welcome to the documentation of the dart-linux-interactor (DLI) library.

The main purpose of this project is to connect Dart-based applications and libraries with Linux-based libraries.

# 🧠 Reasoning

I am planning to create my own Linux Kernel-based operation system.

It will have only Dart and Linux pure C/C++ modules. 

Thus to interact or communicate between Dart and Linux sides there is a need for the layer between.

For now, we have the most popular way to do it is Dart FFI. But it is too poor for my tasks.

I need something with the following features:
* multi-isolates to multi-thread interaction
* multi-threads to multi-isolate interaction
* pools for objects and buffers out-of-the-box
* lock-free (at least at user-code level)

So I've decided to combine all these features into a single library for Dart + Linux interaction.

# 🔨 Usage

There are two parts of DLI: Native and Dart. 

### How to use the Dart part?

Firstly you need to add dependency to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
dependencies:
  linux_interactor:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/antonbashir/dart-linux-interactor
      path: dart
```

Then you need to generate FFI bindings for your native code.

Now you can use DLI:

```dart title="main.dart"
Future<void> main(List<String> args) async {
  final interactor = Interactor();
  final worker = InteractorWorker(interactor.worker(InteractorDefaults.worker()));
  await worker.initialize();
  final producer = worker.producer(/* Your producer here */);
  worker.consumer(/* Your consumer here */);
  worker.activate();
  /* Your code here */ 
  await interactor.shutdown();
}
```

### How to use the Native part?

The native part placed here [include](https://github.com/antonbashir/dart-linux-interactor/tree/main/native/include).

You can use your own C/C++ manager to download and include the headers.

Then you need to load the [library](https://github.com/antonbashir/dart-linux-interactor/blob/main/dart/native) and you will be able to use DLI Native API.

# 💥 Samples

A basic sample of usage lives [here](https://github.com/antonbashir/dart-linux-sample). 

# ✋ Limitations

The main limitation is resource control management on the user side. 

It means that if you need to receive a string from the native part then you should `allocate` the string in the Dart part and `free` it also in the Dart part.

This limitation comes from the principle that: the requester controls the resources.h

This way allows us to use efficient lock-free single-thread pools and buffers because `allocation` and `free` operations happen on the same thread/isolate.
